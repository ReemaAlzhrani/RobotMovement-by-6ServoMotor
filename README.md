# ROBOT MOVEMENT BY 6 SERVO MOTORS :
Algorithm for Connecting and Programming a Circuit with 6 Servo Motors and Simulating Robot Walking Motion including pseducode 

# MOVEMENT 
First 3 sevros represent joints of robot left legs ( hips - knee - ankle ) 
the rest servos repersent joints of robot right leg 

 Leg movement based on these photos :

so :
lowering the hip we need smaller angle // larger angle to lift the hip 
strating the knees we need 90 degrees angle // greater than 90 degrees to bend it 
pointing the foot by the ankle we need greater //lefting it with angle less then 90 degrees
